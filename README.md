# Proxy Scraper

This repository contains a Python script that continuously gathers proxies from multiple sources. It scrapes MTProto and SOCKS5 proxies from [mtpro.xyz](https://mtpro.xyz), monitors several pastebin-like feeds for `IP:PORT` entries, listens to numerous IRC channels where proxies are shared, polls a few open proxy APIs, and periodically collects public Tor relay addresses from the [Onionoo](https://onionoo.torproject.org) service. New proxies are written to `proxies.txt` and may be prefixed with `http:` or `socks5:` when the protocol is detected.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- `requests` library (`pip install requests`)
- `beautifulsoup4` (`pip install beautifulsoup4`)
- `uvloop` (`pip install uvloop`) for best performance

## Usage
Run the scraper:

```bash
python3 scrape_proxies.py
```

The script continuously fetches the latest proxies from `https://mtpro.xyz/api/?type=mtproto` and `https://mtpro.xyz/api/?type=socks`, listens on many proxy-sharing IRC channels, queries a collection of free proxy APIs, scrapes several public proxy listing websites, and checks the configured paste feeds. Newly discovered proxies are deduplicated and stored per protocol in files like `http_proxies.txt` or `socks5_proxies.txt`.

Every address is normalized to the `type:ip:port` format and obvious invalid values are discarded.  When the `TEST_PROXIES=1` environment variable is set the scraper verifies proxies using a connection pool before saving them.
The APIs polled include ProxyScrape, ProxyKingdom, GimmeProxy, PubProxy and ProxySpace. Proxy lists are also fetched from `free-proxy-list.net`, `us-proxy.org`, `sslproxies.org` and `socks-proxy.net` approximately every 10 minutes. ProxySpace endpoints are queried every 20 minutes.
The scraper additionally polls the HTTP, SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 lists from the `Free-Proxy` GitHub project every two minutes. Its aggregated `All_proxies.txt` feed is fetched every five minutes, and the Fresh Proxy List project at `vakhov.github.io` is queried every five minutes to keep the pool up to date. The KangProxy raw lists are checked about every four hours.
The Proxifly free-proxy lists are also checked every five minutes.
Proxies from spys.me are downloaded every five minutes from `https://spys.me/proxy.txt` and `https://spys.me/socks.txt`.
